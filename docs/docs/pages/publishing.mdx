# Publishing

Sequoia makes it simple to publish standard.site documents to the AT Protocol.

## Basics

After completing the initial [setup](/setup) for Sequoia, it's time to publish. Before you go live, try using the `--dry-run` flag to see what will be published.

```bash [Terminal]
sequoia publish --dry-run
```

This will print out the posts that it has discovered, what will be published, and how many. Once everything looks good, send it!

```bash [Terminal]
sequoia publish
```

## Updates

As you publish content Sequoia will store a record of content in `.sequoia-state.json`, keeping tack of the AT URIs for each post and generating content hashes for the content inside each markdown file. When you update a post and run the publish command, Sequoia will generate hashes again, see the difference, and update the existing post rather than creating a new one. 

If you happen to loose the state file or if you want to pull down records you already have published, you can use the `sync` command. 

```bash [Terminal]
sequoia sync
```

Sync will use your ATProto handle to look through all of the `standard.site.document` records on your PDS, and pull down the records that are for the publication in the config.

## Troubleshooting

- If you have files in your markdown directory that should be ignored, use the [`ignore` array in the config](/config#ignoring-files).
