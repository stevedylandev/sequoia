# What is Sequoia?

Sequoia is a simple CLI that can be used to publish Standard.site lexicons to the AT Protocol. Yeah that's a mouthful; let's break it down. 

- [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com) - As the site says, "The AT Protocol is an open, decentralized network for building social applications." In reality it's a bit more than that. It's a new way to publish content to the web that puts control back in the hands of users without sacrificing distrubtion. There's a lot to unpack, but you can find a primer [here](https://stevedylan.dev/posts/atproto-starter/).
- [Lexicons](https://atproto.com/guides/lexicon) - Lexicons are schemas used inside the AT Protocol. If you were to "like" a post, what would that consist of? Probably _who_ liked it, _what_ post was liked, and the _author_ of the post. A unique property of lexicons is that anyone can publish them and have them verified under a domain. Then these lexicons can be used to build apps by pulling a users records, aggregating them using an indexer, and a whole lot more!
- [Standard.site](https://standard.site) - Standard.site is a set of lexicons specially designed for publishing content. It was started by the founders of [leaflet.pub](https://leaflet.pub), [pckt.blog](https://pckt.blog), and [offprint.app](https://offprint.app), with the mission of finding a schema that can be used for blog posts and blog sites themselves (if you don't have a self-hosted blog, definitely check those platforms out!). So far it has proven to be the lexicon of choice for publishing content to ATProto with multiple tools and lexicons revolving around the standard.

The goal of Sequoia is to make it easier for those with existing self-hosted blogs to publish their content to the ATmosphere, no matter what SSG or framework you might be using. As of right now the focus will be static sites, but if there is enough traction there might be a future package that can be used for SSR frameworks too.

Sequoia is MIT open sourced and available on [Tangled](https://tangled.org/stevedylan.dev/sequoia) and [GitHub](https://github.com/stevedylandev/sequoia).
